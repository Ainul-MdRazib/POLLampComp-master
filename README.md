# POLARIS_Companion_App
This project was initiated for the SUTD 50.001 Introduction to Information Systems & Programming course. The scope is to design an Internet-of-Things system, inclusive of an Android app coded in Java and a physical device.

The POLARIS system consists of the POLARIS Companion App and the POLARIS Smart Lamp, linked by a common Firebase Realtime database. The App not only remotely controls the Lamp, but also has an in-app messaging feature with a single shared group chat.

The Smart Lamp can be controlled using buttons on itself, or through the Companion App
